# Writeup
In our development process, we utilized 3 sprints. In our Sprint 0 (on Saturday) we decided on numerous things. First, we discussed each member’s role. Kareem would be the scrum master, responsible for making sure that scrum is both understood and meetings are taking place. Samih would be the product owner, responsible for the upkeep of the product backlog, i.e. updating and curating the tasks and subtasks in our Trello kanban board. Danish would be the main software developer, in charge of technical decisions. 
Second, we also decided on a schedule for our sprints and meetings: we would do one sprint cycle per day spread across three days (Saturday, Sunday, Monday). Regarding the meetings of the two main sprints (Sprints 1 and 2), we had a sprint planning meeting, a daily scrum meeting, and a sprint review at the end of the sprint. Sprint 1’s review also included the planning meeting of Sprint 2. 
Last, we all contributed to the creation of the overall Product Backlog for our software, which we developed based on our functional requirements. From that backlog, we prioritized features, leading us to have our main five features that we put into our Trello board and in our final Product backlog. From those five, we decided to focus on two main features, being the implementation of Coding Challenges as well as the corresponding Learning Path that includes those coding challenges.
Sprint 1 (on Sunday) involved us developing the infrastructure necessary to be able to make progress on our backlog features. This included us setting up our development and testing environments and creating the actual coding infrastructure (files, classes) needed. Sprint 2 (on Monday) involved us developing our two main features and their respective subtasks.
